# Stock Price Prediction Using Time Series Analysis

This repository demonstrates stock price forecasting using two popular models: **ARIMA** and **LSTM**. The goal of this project is to predict stock prices, compare the performance of both models, and visualize the results.

## Project Overview

In this project, we will:
- Load historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance.
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**.
- Build **ARIMA** and **LSTM** models for prediction.
- Compare the results of both models and visualize the forecasts.

## 1. Load and Explore Stock Data

### 1.1 Install and Import Required Libraries

To get started, install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install yfinance matplotlib pandas numpy statsmodels scikit-learn tensorflow keras
